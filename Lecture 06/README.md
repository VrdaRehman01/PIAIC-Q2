## ‚ú® PIAIC Lecture 6: Sunday Session Recap by Warda Rehman

Welcome to the **sixth class of PIAIC (Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing)**, held at **Sindh Boy Scouts Association**. Today‚Äôs session covers **Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Tool/Function Calling**. These concepts are essential for optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and improving response efficiency.

We will go through **the working mechanisms, advantages, and limitations** of these AI techniques. Additionally, we will explore **practical implementations in Python and Google GenAI** for **function calling, RAG-based search, and tool integrations**.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation) 

### **What is CAG?**
Cache-Augmented Generation (CAG) utilizes **cached memory** to provide **faster responses** to user queries. Instead of retrieving external data each time, the model looks up **previously stored responses** to enhance performance.

### **Why Use CAG?**
- **Speed & Efficiency**: Reduces computational overhead by using in-memory cache.
- **Lower Latency** : Eliminates the need for external database lookups.
- **Ideal for Static Data**: Works well when the required data remains unchanged.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

### **What is RAG?**
RAG is a framework that enhances AI-generated responses by **retrieving relevant information from an external database (e.g., Pinecone)** before generating an answer.


### **Benefits of RAG**
- **Higher Accuracy**: Reduces hallucinations by referencing factual data.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large datasets.

### **Drawbacks of RAG**
- **Higher Latency**: Requires additional time for database lookups.
- **Complex Setup**: Needs integration with vector databases and embeddings.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ CAG vs. RAG 

| **Feature**            | **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** | **CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation)** |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Data Retrieval**     | Real-time search from a database       | Preloaded context in cache         |
| **Latency**           | Higher due to database fetch           | Lower due to memory lookup         |
| **Scalability**       | Best for large, dynamic data           | Suitable for static datasets       |
| **Complexity**        | Higher (requires DB & setup)           | Lower (no external retrieval)      |

üìå **Key Insight:** Use **RAG for evolving data** and **CAG for quick lookups on static information**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Latency Considerations 

- **Latency** is the time delay between input and response.
- **RAG** experiences higher latency due to external database lookups.
- **CAG** minimizes latency by utilizing memory-based caching.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Tool (Function) Calling 

### **What is Tool Calling?**
Tool calling allows an LLM to **execute specific functions** for specialized tasks like:
- **Mathematical Calculations**
- **Color Conversions**
- **Database Queries**

### **Python Example: RGB to HEX Conversion**
```python
def convert_rgb_to_hex(r, g, b):
    return '#{:02x}{:02x}{:02x}'.format(r, g, b)

def convert_hex_to_rgb(hex_code):
    hex_code = hex_code.strip('#')
    return tuple(int(hex_code[i:i+2], 16) for i in (0, 2, 4))

print(convert_rgb_to_hex(255, 87, 51))  # Output: '#FF5733'
print(convert_hex_to_rgb('#FF5733'))    # Output: (255, 87, 51)
```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Google GenAI Function Calling 

### **Modes of Function Calling**
- **NONE**: Text-only mode (no function execution).
- **AUTO**: Automatically calls functions when needed.
- **ANY**: Allows model-driven function execution.

### **Example Use Case: Smart Light Control**
User input: _‚ÄúSet the bedroom light to a relaxing color.‚Äù_
- **LLM detects intent** and calls `change_light_color()`.
- The function executes, changing the actual light.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Advantages, Disadvantages, and Limitations 

| **Approach** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Tool Calling** | Expands LLM capabilities with precise function execution | Requires well-defined functions |
| **RAG** | Provides factual accuracy via retrieved data | Requires complex database integration |
| **CAG** | Provides quick responses using cache | Limited to static data |

## Wrap-Up

This session covered **CAG, RAG, and Tool Calling**, along with their practical applications. We explored how **caching reduces latency**, how **RAG enhances factual accuracy**, and how **function calling expands LLM capabilities**. Additionally, we implemented **Google GenAI‚Äôs function calling** to connect AI with real-world actions.
